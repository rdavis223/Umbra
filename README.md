# Umbra
In a post apocalyptic world, you are trapped in a forest full of zombies. Your goal is to find a helicopter located somewhere in the forest to escape!<br>

Created in Unity 3D for 4483 Game Design Prototype <br>

<b>How to Play: </b> <br>
To simply play the game, just open one of the executabels located at the root of the repository. These are labelled "Umbra - Mac" and "Umbra - PC" for use on either Mac or Windows platforms. To view the Source Code and Editor, simply open the project folder in Unity version 2020.1.13f1.  

<b>Controls:</b> <br>
Move: WASD keys<br>
Jump: Space Bar <br>
Look/Aim: Mouse<br>
Melee Attack: Left Mouse Button<br>
Draw on trees: Right Mouse Button - Use this feature to place markers on trees to help mark locations and orient yourself as you navigate the forest. Hold mouse button while looking at a tree and move mouse to draw any shape you want on the trees. <br>
Escape Key - Pause Menu <br>

<b>List Of Features: </b><br>
Intended to be a Horizontal prototype, featuring most of the functionality planned for the game in a basic way and provide a good general feel for how the final product might look. <br>
-Basic first person movement and jumping.<br>
-Melee Combat against Zombies using knife. <br>
-Draw markers on trees to aid with orienteering. <br>
-Basic Enemy AI: ZombiesAIs will patrol the forest. They will run towards the player when in range and attack when close to the player, they will also stop attacking for a short period of time and display a knockback animation when attacked. <br>
-Player and Zombie health systems. <br>
-Zombies spawn in random locations, and the number of zombies that spawn increase incrementally over time. <br>
-Compass to help player orient themselves. <br>
-Two buildings that are provided as locations to help the player orient themselves in the forest. <br>
-Completely randomized layout for each playthough, includes position of trees, buildings, and escape helicopter (goal). <br>
-Pause Menu UI and Basic Start Menu UI. <br>


<b>Some Notes For Markers:</b><br>
-Amount of zombies increase every 120 seconds. Don’t be alarmed if you don’t see a ton of enemies at the beginning <br>
-Remember since your only weapon is a small knife, you will have to get pretty close to zombies in order to damage them! Try to time it so you hit them before they hit you! <br>
-I encourage you to play the game as intended, but I understand that marking can be a time consuming task. Because of this I added a Hint function that will help you find the helicopter to test that the goal exists and works. Pressing the L key will cause the player to automatically turn in the direction towards the helicopter. <br>
-Originally in my pitch, I planned for the compass to be a tool that the player has to find in the game world in order to use. While developing, I found that the orienteering proved too difficult without a compass, so I decided to add it as a default. <br>
-I did not have the time to add additional weapons, a durability system, or the unique health system planned in my pitch for this prototype. I am still planning to add these elements to the game if development moves forward. <br>
