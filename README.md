# Umbra
In a post apocalyptic world, you are trapped in a forest full of zombies. Your goal is to find a helicopter located somewhere in the forest to escape!<br>

Created in Unity 3D for 4483 Game Design Prototype <br>

<b>How to Play: </b> <br>
To simply play the game, just open one of the executabels located at the root of the repository. These are labelled "Umbra - Mac" and "Umbra - PC" for use on either Mac or Windows platforms. To view the Source Code and Editor, simply open the project folder in Unity version 2020.1.13f1.  

<b>Controls:</b> <br>
Move: WASD keys<br>
Look/Aim: Mouse<br>
Melee Attack: Left Mouse Button<br>
Draw on trees: Right Mouse Button - Use this feature to place markers on trees to help mark locations and orient yourself as you navigate the forest. Hold mouse button and move mouse to draw any shape you want on the trees. <br>
Escape Key - Pause Menu <br>

<b>Some Notes For Markers:</b><br>
-Amount of zombies increase every 120 seconds. Don’t be alarmed if you don’t see a ton of enemies at the beginning <br>
-Remember since your only weapon is a small knife, you will have to get pretty close to zombies in order to damage them! Try to time it so you hit them before they hit you! <br>
-I encourage you to play the game as intended, but I understand that marking can be a time consuming task. Because of this I added a Hint function that will help you find the helicopter to test that the goal exists and works. Pressing the L key will cause the player to automatically turn in the direction towards the helicopter. <br>
-Originally in my pitch, I planned for the compass to be a tool that the player has to find in the game world in order to use. While developing, I found that the orienteering proved too difficult without a compass, so I decided to add it as a default. <br>
-I did not have the time to add additional weapons for this prototype, and hence a durability system. I am still planning to add these elements to the game if development moves forward. <br>
